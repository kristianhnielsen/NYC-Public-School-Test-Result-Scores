    "Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n",

    "Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n",

    "\n",
    "- The best math results are at least 80% of the *maximum possible score of 800* for math.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called `top_10_schools` containing the `\"school_name\"` and a new column named `\"total_SAT\"`, with results ordered by `\"total_SAT\"` in descending order (`\"total_SAT\"` being the sum of math, reading, and writing scores).\n",

    "Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called `largest_std_dev`.\n",

    "    - `\"borough\"` - the name of the NYC borough with the largest standard deviation of `\"total_SAT\"`.\n",
    "    - `\"num_schools\"` - the number of schools in the borough.\n",
